    use multi-process and multi-thread can realize system multi-task
event(complicated task).

    linux posix realize multi-thread c++ programs. Multi-thread Api:
posix threads/PThreads.
    pthreads/posix threads: portable operation system interface threads api

c++ multi-thread

#include <pthread.h>
